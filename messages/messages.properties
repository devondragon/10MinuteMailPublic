aboutIndex1 = By clicking on the link below, you will be given a temporary e-mail address. Any e-mails sent to that address will show up automatically on the web page. You can read them, click on links, and even reply to them. The e-mail address will expire after 10 minutes.

aboutIndex2 = Why would you use this? Maybe you want to sign up for a site which requires that you provide an e-mail address to send a validation e-mail to. And maybe you don't want to give up your real e-mail address and end up on a bunch of spam lists. This is nice and disposable. And it's free. Enjoy!

aboutIndex3 = When I launched 10minutemail.com, tons of forum admins decried the idea. They screamed that it would let spammers on to their forums, and that they wouldn't sell e-mail lists to spammers, etc...

aboutIndex4 = A month goes by, and let's see what we have. My server used to get around 200-300 e-mail a day. In the past week it averaged 60,000-70,000 e-mail a day. Virtually all of those were to old (expired) 10minutemail.com accounts. Presumably virtually all spam.

aboutIndex5 = 70,000 a day!? This proves that the average person simply CAN'T trust a random site or forum with their real e-mail address. Are there some forums/sites that are trustworthy? Sure! Does the average net user have any ability to tell with certainty if a given site or forum will sell their e-mail address or spam them direction? Unfortunately not.

aboutIndex6 = This drives home the importance of the service.

aboutIndex7 = In order to save my server from the crushing spam, I've swapped out the e-mail domain to fificorp.com, and then fificorp.net, and will continue to swap out the e-mail domain on a regular basis. This will serve two purposes. One, it will save my server from dying under the flood of spam. Two, it will keep admins who block registrations by domain on their toes at least once a month.

faq = Frequently Asked Questions

faqQuestion1 = What is 10MinuteMail?
faqAnswer1 = 10MinuteMail is a secure temporary email service. This means that it lets you have a private email address, that anyone can send mail to. The email and the address both self-destruct in 10 minute, so you don't have to worry about SPAM or anything like that.

faqQuestion2 = Why would I use 10MinuteMail?
faqAnswer2 = The most common reason to use a temporary email service like 10MinuteMail, is if you are forced to give an email address to a website you don't fully trust. Many websites force you to register in order to see content. Many of those websites will then either send you SPAM for years, or even worse, sell your email address to large scale SPAM operations. 10MinuteMail allows you to easily give an email address that won't exist in 10 minutes, so there's no risk of SPAM. If the website makes you verify the email address by sending you a link you have to click on, to your email, then you can read the email right here on www.10minutemail.com and click on the link. You can also reply to email, as some sites require a reply. You can forward the email to your personal account if there's some information you need to save.


faqQuestion3 = How do I use 10MinuteMail?
faqAnswer3Step1 = When you need an email address, to fill out an online form or registration with, just open another window or tab and go to <a href="https://10minutemail.com/">10MinuteMail.com</a>.
faqAnswer3Step2 = The email address you see on the page is yours. You are the only person who can see that address.
faqAnswer3Step3 = You can copy it from the window, or just click on the icon that looks like two sheets of paper which will automatically copy the email address to your clipboard. DO NOT CLOSE the <a href="https://10minutemail.com/">10MinuteMail.com</a> window.
faqAnswer3Step4 = Then paste the email address into the website you needed it for, complete the registration/form/whatever.
faqAnswer3Step5 = If the site sends you an email, it should show up on the <a href="https://10minutemail.com/">10MinuteMail.com</a> page, down on the page, under the Messages section. It may take a couple of minutes to arrive.
faqAnswer3Step6 = Once you see it there, just click on it, and you can read the email. Then you can click on any links, or get any information you need.
faqAnswer3Step7 = When you are done, just close the <a href="https://10minutemail.com/">10MinuteMail.com</a> window, or wait for the 10 minutes to expire. That's it.

faqQuestion4 = Do I need to sign up or provide any information to you?
faqAnswer4 = Nope! The idea of 10MinuteMail is to be as fast and simple as possible. Just hit the site and you have a private secure address ready and waiting for you. You don't need to do ANYTHING!

faqQuestion5 = How safe/secure/private is 10MinuteMail?
faqAnswer5 = Unlike many similar temporary email services, 10MinuteMail is built around privacy and security. You get a private unique email address that no one else gets. You are the only person who can see that email's inbox. No one else can see your email. Period.

faqQuestion6 = What happens to my email after the 10 minutes is up?
faqAnswer6 = After your email address expires, all of your email is deleted, and the address itself stops working a minute later.

faqQuestion7 = What if I need more time?
faqAnswer7 = If the email you are waiting for still hasn't arrived, you can click on the link that says Give me 10 More Minutes, which will reset the countdown timer.

faqQuestion8 = What shouldn't I use 10MinuteMail for?
faqAnswer8 = If you trust the site, then it's probably easiest to use your real email address. If it's an IMPORTANT account, that you might need to send a password reset email for, you shouldn't use 10MinuteMail. Many people have lost accounts when they forgot the password, and had left their account email as a long expired 10MinuteMail address.

faqQuestion9 = Can you recover an email I lost, or got sent after the 10 minutes were up?
faqAnswer9 = I'm sorry but I can't. The emails are never saved and I never have access to them. They are truly temporary!

faqQuestion10 = No really, HOW secure is it?
faqAnswer10 = It's PRETTY secure... Most email, by the nature of the whole email system, is sent un-encrypted, and may go through many servers between it's sender and it's recipient. So email isn't a super secure way to communicate, period. You can read more about that here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_privacy" target="_new">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_privacy</a>.   If you want really secure email you need to encrypt the emails using PGP/GPG. You can read about that here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy" target="_new">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy</a>. You shouldn't use 10MinuteMail to do anything illegal. Period. But it's safe from most prying eyes!
